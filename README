shazer - find and hardlink duplicate files based on checksums


Generate a checksums file with your favorite shasum program and list
the space that could be recovered by hardlinking duplicate files.

Run with -v to list all duplicates, run with -x to create the hardlinks.

---

usage: shazer.py [-xvai] [-s minsize[:maxsize]] [-g globpat] shasums

Options:
  -x           execute; link duplicate files (default is dry-run)
  -v           verbose; show each file pair to be linked
  -a           process already linked files too
  -g globpat   only consider files matching globpat ('%'->'*')
  -i           globpat is case-insensitive
  -s min[:max] ignore files outside of size range

Generate shasums with:
  find dir/ [...] -type f -exec sha1sum {} + > shasums
